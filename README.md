I graduated Summa Cum Laude from California Baptist University with a double major in communication studies and leadership studies in 2020 and am now working as an estimator at Autajon Packaging. As an estimator, I realized I enjoyed the feeling of accomplishment when solving complex mathematical and logical problems using programs like excel and using data from CRMs. After this realization, I wanted to seek opportunities to apply my learnings about communication and leadership in a more technical setting, which is why I received the Google Data Analytics Certificate. I believe that data driven decision-making is the future of the successful organization, but the data is close to useless without the ability to effectively lead change and communicate these changes. This is why I am looking for opportunities as a business/data analyst, as I believe I would be effective at not only the technical side of things but the human side of data as well.
